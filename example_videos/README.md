# Example Videos

## Overview
This folder contains example videos related to the laser heating simulation. These videos demonstrate various outputs generated by the simulation and video merging process, providing a reference for users to understand the expected results.

## Contents
- **`simulation_video.mp4`**: A sample video generated by the simulation, showing the heat dispersion over time on a metallic surface.
- **`output_video.mp4`**: The processed output video created by the simulation.
- **`SimilarityVideo.mp4`**: A similarity video that highlights pixel-by-pixel matches and differences between the simulation and an input video. Matching pixels are shown in green, while differing pixels are in red.
- **`merged_video.mp4`**: The final merged video displaying the input video, simulation output, and similarity overlay for side-by-side comparison.

## Usage
These example videos are provided for reference. Users can compare their own simulation and merged outputs with these samples to ensure their setup is functioning as expected.

1. **Simulation Output**: View `simulation_video.mp4` to observe a typical simulation result.
2. **Processed Output**: Refer to `output_video.mp4` as an example of the simulation's generated output.
3. **Similarity Analysis**: Use `SimilarityVideo.mp4` to see the color-coded comparison between the input and simulation output, with matching and differing pixels clearly displayed.
4. **Merged Video**: Watch `merged_video.mp4` to see the combined result with side-by-side comparison and similarity overlay.

These examples help users verify that the system is operating correctly and provide a baseline for expected results.
