# Example Photos

## Overview
This folder contains example screenshots of the GUI and the output from the laser heating simulation, as well as an image of the presentation created for the Dean's Research Awards. These images provide visual examples of the interface and outputs, helping users understand what to expect from the system.

## Contents
- **`GUI_picture.png`**: Screenshot of the GUI interface where users can set parameters for the simulation.
- **`Video_photo.png`**: Example frame from the similarity video, showing green pixels for matching areas and red pixels for differing areas.
- **`presentation.pptx.png`**: Image of the presentation slide created for the Dean's Research Awards, summarizing the project.

## Usage
These images are provided as a visual reference:

1. **GUI Interface**: Use `GUI_picture.png` to see how the parameter input screen should look.
2. **Similarity Video Output**: Refer to `Video_photo.png` for an example of the similarity overlay with color-coded pixel matches.
3. **Presentation Slide**: `presentation.pptx.png` showcases the summary of the project presented for the Dean's Research Awards.

These images offer guidance for setting up the GUI and provide insight into the projectâ€™s presentation for academic recognition.
